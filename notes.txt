Split into two panels
    each panel has list of menu items
    each item has { name, description, price }

determine how many cards can fit vertically on screen
    if all can fit, only draw left
    if not, draw max on left and rest on right

Items start from top left panel
    each item goes below prior
    once left is out of space, begin adding to right
    All items must fit into vieport w/out scrolling
    panels centered vertically and horizontally


Must be able to edit menu
    Button "Add Menu Item"
        brings up modal with inputs for { name, description, price }
        on save add's item to Menu

make semicolon use consistent
refactor modal validation
